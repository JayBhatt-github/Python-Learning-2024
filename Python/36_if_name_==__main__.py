# What does the if __name__ == “__main__”: do in python ?


# The if __name__ == "__main__": statement in Python is used to check whether the current script is being run directly or being imported as a module into another script. 
# When the script is run directly, the __name__ variable is set to "__main__", and the code block inside the if statement will be executed. 
# This is commonly used to define the behavior of a script when it is run directly, such as running tests or performing specific tasks. 
# It allows the same script to be used both as a standalone program and as a module in another program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Code to be executed when the script is run directly
    print("This script is being run directly")
    # Additional code can be added here to perform specific tasks when the script is run directly
